## **Step 1: Install Fedora Workstation**

1. Download the Fedora Workstation ISO file from the [official Fedora website](https://getfedora.org/).
2. Create a bootable USB drive using tools like \*\*Rufus, Etcher, Ventoy (Recommended)\*\*
3. Boot your system from the USB drive and follow the installation instructions to set up Fedora (You must have a phone that supports USB Tethering with a USB cable that supports it as well to install Fedora as you cannot connect to wifi while installing it)

## **Step 2: Optimize DNF Configuration**

Make your package manager faster by tweaking its configuration:

1. Open the DNF configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
```
2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:
```
max_parallel_downloads=7
fastestmirror=True
```
3. Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).

## **Step 3: Update Your System**

After installation, update your system to ensure you have the latest packages:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

---

## **Step 4: Add RPM Fusion Repositories (Free and Non-Free)**

```bash
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm 
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```

## **Step 5: Connect to Wi-Fi**

If your Wi-Fi isnâ€™t working out of the box, follow these steps:

1. **Find Your Wi-Fi Driver:**

   ```bash
   lspci | grep -i network
   ```

   This will show the Wi-Fi hardware. Note the driver needed.

2. **Install the Driver:**

   ```bash
   sudo dnf install <driver-package-name>
   ```

   Replace `<driver-package-name>` with the appropriate driver (e.g., `broadcom-wl` for Broadcom cards).
   (Reboot to apply the changes)

3. **Load the Module:**

   ```bash
   sudo modprobe wl
   ```
4. **Connect to Wi-Fi:**
   Use the menu of GNOME in top right to connect to your Wi-Fi network. (logout and login if not working)

## **Step 6: Clone Your Dotfiles Repository**

Set up your development environment by cloning your dotfiles:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deshraj-Tiwari-Official/Fedora-Powerhouse.git ~/dotfiles
```

---

## **Step 7: Run the Setup Script**

Make all the shell scripts recursively executable and run the setup script:

```bash
find ~/dotfiles -type f -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} +
~/dotfiles/00_scripts/setup.sh
```

READ the output of the script and follow the instructions to complete the setup.

## **Step 9: Final Touches**

- Reboot once to have a good feeling of the freshly installed Fedora system
  ```bash
  reboot
  ```
  - Remember to boot in Hyprland this time :) {There would be a tiny gear icon in the login screen to do so}
- Enjoy your freshly configured Fedora Powerhouse!
